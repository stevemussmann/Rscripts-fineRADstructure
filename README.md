# Rscripts-fineRADstructure

The scripts in this repository are modified from https://github.com/millanek/fineRADstructure to accept command line input. To see options, execute fineRADstructurePlot.R at a command prompt with the --help option.

You will still need to set the path to FinestructureLibrary.R in the fineRADstructurePlot.R script.
